# Standard Order of Terms
#
#Comparison and unification of arbitrary terms. Terms are ordered in the so called ``standard order''. This order is defined as follows:
#
#   1. Variables < Atoms < Strings < Numbers < Terms (25)
#   2. Variables are sorted by address. Attaching attributes (see section 6.1) does not affect the ordering.
#   3. Atoms are compared alphabetically.
#   4. Strings are compared alphabetically.
#   5. Numbers are compared by value. Integers and floats are treated identically. If the prolog_flag (see current_prolog_flag/2) iso is defined, all floating point numbers precede all integers.
#   6. Compound terms are first checked on their arity, then on their functor-name (alphabetically) and finally recursively on their arguments, leftmost argument first.

+Condition -> +Action
    If-then and If-Then-Else. The ->/2 construct commits to the choices made at its left-hand side, destroying choice-points created inside the clause (by ;/2), or by goals called by this clause. Unlike !/0, the choice-point of the predicate as a whole (due to multiple clauses) is not destroyed. The combination ;/2 and ->/2 acts as if defines by:

    If -> Then; _Else :- If, !, Then.
    If -> _Then; Else :- !, Else.
    If -> Then :- If, !, Then.

    Please note that (If -> Then) acts as (If -> Then ; fail), making the construct fail if the condition fails. This unusual semantics is part of the ISO and all de-facto Prolog standards.

+Condition *-> +Action ; +Else
    This construct implements the so-called `soft-cut'. The control is defined as follows: If Condition succeeds at least once, the semantics is the same as (Condition, Action). If Condition does not succeed, the semantics is that of (\+ Condition, Else). In other words, If Condition succeeds at least once, simply behave as the conjunction of Condition and Action, otherwise execute Else.

    The construct A *-> B, i.e. without an Else branch, is translated as the normal conjunction A, B. (28)

\+ +Goal
    Succeeds if `Goal' cannot be proven (mnemonic: + refers to provable and the backslash (\) is normally used to indicate negation in Prolog).
